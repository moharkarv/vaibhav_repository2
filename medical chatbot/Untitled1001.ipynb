The Pocket Book is for use by doctors, nurses and other health workers who are responsible for the care of young children at the ﬁ rst level referral hospitals. This second edition is based on evidence from several WHO updated and published clinical guidelines. It is for use in both inpatient and outpatient care in small hospitals with basic laboratory facilities and essential medicines. In some settings, these guidelines can be used in any facilities where sick children are admitted for inpatient care. The Pocket Book is one of a series of documents and tools that support the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). The guidelines require the hospital to have (1) the capacity to carry out certain essential investigations, such as pulse oximetry, blood glucose, blood smear examinations for malaria parasites, estimation of haemoglobin, packed cell volume and full blood count, blood group and cross-match, and basic microscopy of cerebrospinal ﬂ uid and urine; and where possible blood and urine culture, ultrasound and basic x-rays; (2) essential medicines for the care of seriously ill children. Advanced and high care treatment options, such as intensive care or mechanical ventilation, are not described. These guidelines focus on the management of the major causes of childhood mortality in most developing countries, such as newborn problems, pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, septicaemia, measles and related conditions, severe acute malnutrition and paediatric HIV/AIDS. It also covers some common surgical conditions that can be managed in small hospitals. Details of the evidence on which the Pocket Book is based can be found on WHO website from the published guidelines provided in the bibliography. These guidelines are applicable in most areas of the world and may be adapted to suit country speciﬁ c circumstances. The online version will be updated regularly as new evidence emerges.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'chapter': 'Preface', 'section': None}, page_content='This is the second edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Pocket book of hospital care for children, which was ﬁ rst published in 2005. It is a compila- tion of the updated WHO guidelines for the management of common childhood illnesses at the ﬁ rst-referral level in low-resource countries. It presents relevant, up-to-date, evidence-based clinical guidelines that can be used by clinicians in their daily work in hospitals with basic laboratory facilities and inexpensive medicines. The guidelines focus on inpatient management of children who are severely ill with conditions that are major causes of childhood mortality, such as neonatal illness, pneumonia, diarrhoea, fever (mainly malaria, meningitis and septicaemia), severe acute malnutrition and HIV/AIDS. It also includes guidance on common surgical problems, appropriate supportive care and monitoring of patients on the ward. The Pocket book is part of a series of tools for improving the quality of care for severely ill children and is consistent with the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines for outpatient management of sick chil- dren. It is for use by doctors, senior nurses and other senior health workers who are responsible for the care of young children at the ﬁ rst referral level in developing countries. The ﬁ rst edition of the Pocket book was reviewed by a WHO guidelines steering committee, which identiﬁ ed those chapters that required updating, comprising: revisions to align the Pocket book with recently published, WHO-approved guidelines; and (cid:129) priorities for which new information had become available, which was col- lated, analysed and synthesized before updating. In the ﬁ rst category, recommendations approved by the WHO Guidelines Re- view Committee were incorporated. The second category required synthesis of evidence and updates consistent with new recommendations. The changes made are therefore based on published WHO guidelines and recommendations as of 2012, which are listed in the bibliography on p. 329; in addition, certain subsections were added or removed, others reorganized and some editorial changes made on the basis of feedback from Pocket book users. In response to users’ feedback and the popularity of the ﬁ rst edition, the presentation is similar.'),\n",

After this time, there is usually little beneﬁ t, except for agents that delay gastric empty- ing or in patients who are deeply unconscious. A decision to undertake gastric decontamination must weigh the likely beneﬁ ts against the risks associated with each method. Gastric decontamination does not guarantee that all the substance has been removed, so the child may still be in danger.

Make sure a suction apparatus is available in case the child vomits. Place the child in the left lateral head-down position. Measure the length of tube to be inserted.

The symptom-speciﬁ c chapters give some guidance on questions that should be asked about symptoms, which help in a differential diagnosis of the illness. These include personal, vaccination, family, social and environmental histories. They might lead to important counselling messages, such as sleeping under a bednet for a child with malaria, breastfeeding or sanitary practices for a child with diarrhoea, or reducing exposure to indoor air pollution for a child with pneumonia. Taking history In younger infants, the history of pregnancy and birth is important. The feed- ing history of infants and younger children is essential, as this is often when malnutrition begins. For older children, information on development milestones is important. Whereas the history is obtained from a parent or caretaker for younger children, older children can contribute important information. You must establish a rapport with the child and the parent before starting the examination. In general, children between the ages of 8 months and 5 years require the most ﬂ exible approach. 2.3 All children must be examined fully, so that no important sign is missed. In contrast to the systematic approach for adults, however, examination of a child should be organized in a way that does not upset the child. The approach to examining children should be ﬂ exible.

These and other signs should be recorded before the child is disturbed. You might ask the mother or caretaker to cautiously reveal part of the chest to look for lower chest wall indrawing or to count the respiratory rate. If the child is distressed or crying, he or she might have to be left for a brief time with its mother in order to settle, or the mother could be ask to breastfeed, before key signs such as respiratory rate can be measured. Then proceed to signs that require touching the child but are minimally dis- turbing, such as feeling the pulse or listening to the chest. You obtain little useful information if you listen to the chest of a crying child.

Assessment of severely malnourished children is described in sections 7.2 and 7.4.3 (pp. 198 and 203). The three essential ele- ments in the management of all children with diarrhoea are rehydration therapy, zinc supplementation and counselling for continued feeding and prevention. In diarrhoea, there is excess loss of water, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate) and zinc in liquid stools. Dehydration occurs when these losses are not adequately replaced and there are deﬁ cits of water and electrolytes. The degree of dehydration is graded according to symptoms and signs that reﬂ ect the amount of ﬂ uid lost; see sections 2.3 (p. 43) and 5.2 (p. 127). The rehydration regimen is selected according to the degree of dehydration. All children with diarrhoea should receive zinc supplements. During diarrhoea, decreased food intake and nutrient absorption and increased nutrient requirements often combine to cause weight loss and failure to grow. Malnutrition can make diarrhoea more severe, more prolonged and more frequent than in well-nourished children.

Geological evidence suggests that the bridge was formerly a land connection between India and Sri Lanka.[1]\\n\\nThe feature is 48\\xa0km (30\\xa0mi) long and separates the Gulf of Mannar (southwest) from the Palk Strait (northeast). Some regions of the bridge are dry, and the sea in the area rarely exceeds 1 metre (3\\xa0ft) in depth, making it quite difficult for boats to pass over it.[1]\\n\\nIbn Khordadbeh\\'s Kitāb al-Masālik wa-l-Mamālik (c.\\u2009850) refers to the structure as Set Bandhai (lit. Bridge of the Sea).[2] The name Adam\\'s Bridge appeared probably around the time of Al-Biruni (c.\\u20091030).[2] This appears to have been premised on the Islamic belief that Adam\\'s Peak — where the biblical Adam fell to earth — is located in Sri Lanka, and that Adam crossed over to peninsular India via the bridge after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden.[3]\\n\\nThe ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana (8th century BCE–3rd century CE) mentions a bridge constructed by the god Rama to reach the island Lanka and rescue his wife Sita from Ravana. In popular belief, Lanka is equated to present-day Sri Lanka and the bridge is described as \"Rama\\'s Setu\".[4]\\n\\nDue to lowered sea levels during the Last Glacial Period (115,000–11,700 years Before Present) where sea levels reached a maximum of 120\\xa0m (390\\xa0ft) below present values, the entirety of the relatively shallow Palk Strait (which reaches a maximum depth of only 35\\xa0m (115\\xa0ft)) was exposed as dry land connecting the mainland Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka. Following the rise to present sea levels during the Holocene, by around 7,000 years ago, the strait became submerged, including the region of Adam\\'s Bridge/Rama Setu. The islands of Adam\\'s Bridge became emergent again following sea level falls in the region from around 5,000 years ago to the present.[5]\\n\\nThe bridge starts as a chain of shoals from the Dhanushkodi tip of India\\'s Pamban Island. It ends at Sri Lanka\\'s Mannar Island. Pamban Island is accessed from the Indian mainland by the 2\\xa0km (1.2\\xa0mi) long Pamban Bridge. Mannar Island is connected to mainland Sri Lanka by a causeway.\\n\\nThe lack of comprehensive field studies explains many of the uncertainties regarding the nature and origin of Adam\\'s Bridge. It mostly consists of a series of parallel ledges of sandstone and conglomerates that are hard at the surface and grow coarse and soft as they descend to sandy banks.[6] The Marine and Water Resources Group of the Space Applications Centre (SAC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) concludes that Adam\\'s Bridge comprises 103 small patch reefs.[6] One study tentatively concludes that there is insufficient evidence to indicate eustatic emergence and that the raised reef in southern India probably results from a local uplift.[7]\\n\\nIn the vicinity of Adam\\'s Bridge/Rama Setu, the water is typically only 1–3\\xa0m (3\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in\\xa0– 9\\xa0ft 10\\xa0in) deep.[5] Due to the shallow waters, Adam\\'s Bridge presents a formidable hindrance to navigation through the Palk Strait. Though trade across the India–Sri Lanka divide has been active since at least the first millennium BC, it was limited to small boats and dinghies. Larger ocean-going vessels from the west have had to navigate around Sri Lanka to reach India\\'s eastern coast.[8] Eminent British geographer Major James Rennell, who surveyed the region as a young officer in the late 18th century, suggested that a \"navigable passage could be maintained by dredging the strait of Ramisseram  [sic]\". However, little notice was given to his proposal, perhaps because it came from \"so young and unknown an officer\", and the idea was only revived 60 years later.\\n\\nIn 1823, Sir Arthur Cotton (then an ensign) was assigned to survey the Pamban channel, which separates the Indian mainland from the island of Rameswaram and forms the first link of Adam\\'s Bridge. Geological evidence indicates that a land connection bridged this in the past, and some Ramanathaswamy Temple records suggest that violent storms broke the link in 1480. Cotton suggested that the channel could be dredged to enable passage of ships, but nothing was done until 1828, when Major Sim directed the blasting and removal of some rocks.[9][10]\\n\\nA more detailed marine survey of Adam\\'s Bridge was undertaken in 1837 by lieutenants F. T. Powell, Ethersey, Grieve, and Christopher, along with draughtsman Felix Jones, and operations to dredge the channel were recommenced the next year.[9][11] However, these and subsequent efforts in the 19th century did not succeed in keeping the passage navigable for any vessels except those with a light draft.[1]\\n\\nThe government of India constituted nine committees before independence, and five committees since th'}\u001b[0m\n",
