This project aims to classify tweets as disaster-related or not using NLP techniques and machine learning. Developed by a team of six members, this project demonstrates the power of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model building to solve real-world problems.



1. Data Collection
[Bhavana Warghane]:

Collected disaster-related data from Kaggle.
Imported the dataset into Jupyter Notebook for further processing.
Hnadle Missing Values
Check Duplicate rows.

3. Data Preprocessing
[Ravichandra]

Applied text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

[Vaibhav Moharkar]:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split with stratification to ensure balanced class distribution.
Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) on the training data to handle class imbalance.

4. Feature Engineering
[Abhishek Gaikwad]

Extracted text-based features using methods such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec.
Optimized feature selection to enhance model performance.


5. Model Development
[Pranita Lokhande]

Implemented machine learning algorithms like XG Boost,SVM and Random Forest. Conducted hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

[Rutuja Kandhare..]

Implemented machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Conducted hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
